We are developing a website that allows the customer to order the bedsheets. 
Then, the customer is asked for the bedsheet color, the number of cartoons they want, and the number of sheets they want.
We will also use the customerâ€™s input to calculate the subtotal, tax which is 0.11 for sales tax, and total. 
Finally, display the receipt with the order information, subtotal, tax, and total; display the code.

This python program allows input from the keyboard, perform some mathematical calculations, indexing, slicing, and displaying output to the screen.
